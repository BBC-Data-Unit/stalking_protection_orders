![aac7ebe3-b45f-4e43-9ac0-9799ea711597](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74192940/122537014-0c10f900-d01d-11eb-8034-0bcf902147ab.png)

In May 2021, the BBC Shared Data Unit worked with Newsbeat and BBC Radio Wales to [report](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57384615) on new stalking laws that were not being used by all police forces in the country to protect victims. 

Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) are a civil power available to police which impose restrictions on suspected stalkers. 

But data showed the use of SPOs, which had been available to police forces in England and Wales since January 2020, varied widely from force to force, with four failing to apply for a single order in the previous fifteen months. 

We also analysed [national crime outcomes data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-recorded-crime-open-data-tables) which showed the number of stalking incidents recorded by police had surged in the previous five years, with more than half of all police forces in England and Wales seeing stalking incidents double since 2019.

The Home Office said it would meet with police chiefs to review their use of the orders.


## Method

The BBC Shared Data Unit sent requests under the Freedom of Information Act and gathered responses from 41 out of 43 police forces across England and Wales.

No response was received from Lincolnshire or North Yorkshire Police.

We asked how many SPOs each force had applied for since January 2020, how many SPOs had been rejected by the courts and how many had been accepted. We also asked how many orders were in the process of being heard by the courts.

Using police recorded crime and outcomes open data (available here), we analysed the number of stalking incidents recorded by each police force since 2015/16. 

The latest data available covers the nine-month period between April 2020 and December 2020. We also used the same outcomes data to calculate a charge rate per year for every police force in England and Wales.
